# Operators

- In an expression like `1 + 2`, the symbol `+` is known as the **Operator**, and the values `1` and `2` are referred to as **Operands**.
- বাংলা : যদি একটি এক্সপ্রেশন `1 + 2` হয় তাহলে সেখানে `+` এই চিহ্নটিকে **Operator** বলা হয়, আর `1` এবং `2` ভ্যালুকে **Operands** বলা হয়

- ## Arithmetic Operator
  - `(+, -, *, /, %)` perform mathematical operations on numeric values.
- ## Assignment Operator
  - (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, `x = 10` assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`.
  - Compound assignment operators (like +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=) combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment.
  - For example, `a += 5` is equivalent to `a = a + 5`, and `b -= 3` is equivalent to `b = b - 3`. These operators perform the arithmetic operation and then assign the result back to the variable.
- ## Comparison Operators
  - `(===, !==, >, <, >=, <=)` compare two values and return a boolean `(true or false)` based on the comparison result.
- ## Logical Operators
  - `(&&, ||, !)` perform logical operations on boolean values. `&&` is the logical AND operator, `||` is the logical OR operator, and `!` is the logical NOT operator.
- ## Conditional / Ternary Operators
  - The conditional or ternary operator (`? :`) is a concise way to write an `if-else` statement in a single line, evaluating a condition and returning one of two expressions based on whether the condition is `true` or `false`. It has the syntax: `condition ? expression1 : expression2`.
