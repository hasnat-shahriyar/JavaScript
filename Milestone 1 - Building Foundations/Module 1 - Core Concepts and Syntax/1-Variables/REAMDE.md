### Variables :

Variables in JavaScript are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. There are three keywords used to declare variables: var, let, and const.

## - var

Before ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), var was the primary way to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with var have function-level scope, which means they are accessible within the function in which they are defined, or globally if defined outside of any function.

## - let

Introduced in ES6, let allows you to declare block-scoped variables. Block-scoped variables are only accessible within the block in which they are defined (e.g., within loops, if statements, or functions).

## - const

Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare constants, which are variables that cannot be reassigned a new value after their initial assignment. Like let, const is block-scoped.
