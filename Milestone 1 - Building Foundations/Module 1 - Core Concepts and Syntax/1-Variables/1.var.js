// Variables
var x = 10;
console.log(x);

// var: Before ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), var was the primary way to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with var have function-level scope, which means they are accessible within the function in which they are defined, or globally if defined outside of any function.
